== Maven Spring Porlet (Liferay) ==

Liferay is a complex platform and for beginners, the learning curve of software development is rather high. At least compared to other modern web technologies.
Therefore, I have created a sample Maven based Spring MVC portlet that people can start to build on.

== Usage ==

Run "mvn package" to create a .war file which can be deployed to Liferay. The portlet is created under "Demos" category in Liferay.

== Supported versions ==

Liferay 6.1.x
